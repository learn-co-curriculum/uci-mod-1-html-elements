# Expanding Your HTML Vocabulary via MDN

## Learning Goals

- Identify the Mozilla Foundation and MDN
- Navigate the MDN Reference Guide

## Introduction

Because of the pace of change in web technologies, it often feels like as soon
as you learn something it's already obsolete. How can a developer stay
up-to-date? Developers need to be able to reference the latest documentation in
a just-in-time fashion.

When you have a question, you should consult the best source, take
what you need, and use it. The purpose of this README is to help you get
oriented with a popular source of HTML documentation, the [Mozilla Developer Network](MDN).

## Identify the Mozilla Foundation and MDN

The Mozilla Foundation is an open-source company that has a long history
with browsers and browser technology.

Mozilla is a reliable reference for the latest HTML tags.  There are many other
sites online that exist to discuss these tags, but when you want a thorough
explanation of a tag, Mozilla is often a great choice.

There are some drawbacks in using MDN.  Because Mozilla is so trusted, their
information tends to be ... _exhaustive_.  Because it's so *ahem* thorough, it
can sometimes be hard to digest.  Their information tends to be for _reference_, not
_tutorial_ purposes.

Drawbacks aside, MDN is a good solid starting place for research and it can
take you from "Does something like this exist?" to "Now I know that this thing
exists, maybe I can find a tutorial!"

## Navigate the MDN Reference Guide

The [MDN HTML Reference Guide](MDN) is a list of HTML tags
grouped together by their functions. These sections are not entirely "human
readable," which makes it a bit difficult to understand where to start looking. 
Some of the headings are very technical-sounding.

To help you find what you need in this listing, we've created this helpful
table to help you convert between MDN-ese and the HTML terms you have learned.
We've also listed only the MDN content sections that you're most likely to use:

_Summary of the MDN HTML reference guide_

|MDN Section Title|Human-Friendly Section Title|Summary|
|------|------|------|
|**Main Root**|The `<html>` tag|*The `<html>` tag and that's it!*|
|**Document metadata**|Website data that goes in the `<head>` tag |*Metadata contains information about the page. Information about styles, scripts and data to help software (search engines, browsers, etc.) use and render the page.*|
|**Sectioning Root**|The `<body>` tag|*The `<body>` tag and that's it!*|
|**Content sectioning**| Headings, titles, division, sections, footers, etc. | *Content sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content into logical pieces.*|
|**Text content**| Formatting for text: list items, horizontal rules, figures listings for under images| *Use HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening `<body>` and closing `</body>` tags.*|
|**Inline text semantics**| Citation, emphasis, underlines, etc. | *Use the HTML inline text semantic to define the meaning, structure, or style of a word, line, or any arbitrary piece of text.*|
|**Image and multimedia**| Adding pictures and media! | *HTML supports various multimedia resources such as images, audio, and video.*|
|**Embedded content**| Advanced: Using material hosted elsewhere on other servers, `<iframe>` is the biggie here | *In addition to regular multimedia content, HTML can include a variety of other content, even if it's not always easy to interact with.*|
|**Scripting**| Advanced: JavaScript and Drawing Support (Vector Graphics) | *In order to create dynamic content and Web applications, HTML supports the use of scripting languages, most prominently JavaScript. Certain elements support this capability.*|
|**Table content**| Tables | *Tables*|
|**Forms**|Advanced: Tags for building forms for sign-up or login, for example, | *HTML provides a number of elements that can be used together to create forms which the user can fill out and submit to the Web site or application. There's a great deal of further information about this available in the HTML forms guide.*|

## Conclusion

As developers, we can handle the speed of technology by relying on guides like
[MDN](MDN) and learn just the little bit we need as we need it.
